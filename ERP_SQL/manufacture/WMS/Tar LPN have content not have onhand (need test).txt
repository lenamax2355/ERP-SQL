Through the script I found 15 LPNs with such problem. Here I am providing the
data-fix script to fix those LPNs. Please apply this data-fix script first on
test instance. Also please note that these scripts are based on the
diagnostic script provided on last update so before applying datafix those 
scripts are needed to be run on test instance.
