fix:

Ideally, step 1 mentioned below should suffice to re-submit the jobs in Pending 
Close status and the rest of the steps are not required. If step 1 fails, for 
any reason then run steps 2 and 3 to set the jobs to the original status, 
delete the records from the WIP_DJ_CLOSE_TEMP table and then re-submit the jobs 
again manually for closure.

If, for whatever reason, the concurrent process is interrupted or terminated, 
records can get stranded in WIP_DJ_CLOSE_TEMP.  Since all of the records in 
this table have status of 'Pending Close', no close routines have been called 
and committed.  

Therefore, all you need to do is reset the job status from Pending Close to 
its previous status in WIP_DISCRETE_JOBS and delete the record from 
WIP_DJ_CLOSE_TEMP.  You will then need to rerun the discrete job closure.

1. Resetting the job status from Pending Close to its previous status.

 1.1  Navigate to Cost/Discrete Jobs/Close Discrete Jobs (Form).
 1.2  Select the job in question and hit the [Open] button.
 1.3  Go to Tools -> close -> select "Check Requests 1".This puts the 
      job back to the status it was in prior to attempting to close 
      (i.e., Complete-No Charges Allowed) and clears out any records that may 
      be erroneously stuck in the WIP_Discrete_Jobs_Close_Temp table that 
      could prevent records from being processed.

2. Delete the records from WIP_DJ_CLOSE_TEMP.

 2.1 To find out the current status of the records in WIP_DISCRETE_JOBS for 
        the records existing in WIP_DJ_CLOSE_TEMP, run this script.

          select temp.wip_entity_id, temp.organization_id org_id,
          substr(temp.wip_entity_name,1,15) dj_name,
          substr(temp.status_type,1,8) tmp_status,
          substr(wdj.status_type,1,8) dj_status
          from wip_dj_close_temp temp, wip_discrete_jobs wdj
          where wdj.wip_entity_id = temp.wip_entity_id;

 2.2 Delete the corresponding records from WIP_DJ_CLOSE_TEMP.

3. Rerun the Discrete Job Closure.

To resubmit for closure go to Special -> Close.  As long as the Inventory 
Accounting Period for the next month is open, the charges will be put into 
that month.
