-----check Error

To implement the solution, please execute the following steps:

Run the following scripts to confirm that erred rows in MMT exist only in the mtl_cst_actual_cost_details table:

1. Check mtl_transaction_accounts (query should return no rows): 
SQL> select mmt.transaction_id
from mtl_material_transactions mmt, 
mtl_transaction_accounts mta,
where mmt.costed_flag = 'E'
and mmt.transaction_id = mta.transaction_id;

2. Check mtl_cst_actual_cost_details (query should return rows):

SQL> select mmt.transaction_id
from mtl_material_transactions mmt, 
mtl_cst_actual_cost_details mcacd
where mmt.costed_flag in ('N','E')
and mmt.organization_id = &org_id
and mmt.transaction_id = mcacd.transaction_id;

3. Check mtl_cst_txn_cost_details (query should return no rows):

select mmt.transaction_id
from mtl_material_transactions mmt, 
mtl_cst_txn_cost_details mctcd
where mmt.costed_flag in ('N','E')
and mmt.organization_id = &org_id
and mmt.transaction_id = mctcd.transaction_id;

4. Check mtl_actual_cost_subelement:

select mmt.transaction_id
from mtl_material_transactions mmt, 
mtl_actual_cost_subelement macs
where mmt.costed_flag in ('N','E')
and mmt.organization_id = &org_id
and mmt.transaction_id = macs.transaction_id;


If only query 2 returns rows, proceed with the following:

1. Backup MTL_CST_ACTUAL_COST_DETAILS table

CREATE TABLE t1_mtl_cst_actual_cost_details
AS (SELECT * FROM mtl_cst_actual_cost_details);

CREATE TABLE t2_mtl_cst_actual_cost_details AS (SELECT * FROM mtl_cst_actual_cost_details mcacd where transaction_id in (select transaction_id fr
om mtl_material_transactions mmt WHERE mmt.costed_flag IN ('N','E') AND mmt.orga
nization_id = &org_id));

CREATE TABLE t3_mtl_material_transactions AS (SELECT * from mtl_material_transactions where costed_flag in ('N','E')); 

2. Delete the records from MTL_CST_ACTUAL_COST_DETAILS which have corresponding records 
(same transaction_id) in mtl_material_transactions with costed_flag = N or E. 

DELETE FROM mtl_cst_actual_cost_details
WHERE transaction_id IN
(SELECT transaction_id
FROM mtl_material_transactions
WHERE costed_flag IN ('N','E')
AND organization_id = &org_id); << the organization_id which has the errors

3. Resubmit the erred rows in mtl_material_transactions. INV: Transactions: Material Transactions:
query the erred rows: From the menu, Tools Select All: Tools Submit All
