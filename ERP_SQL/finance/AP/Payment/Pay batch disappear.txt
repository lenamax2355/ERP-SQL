- not able to see payment batch EH041104USD in payment batch window
- STATUS of the batch in ap_inv_selection_criteria_all is NULL
- 47 rows in ap_selected_invoices_all for that batch
- 12 rows in ap_selected_invoice_checks_all for that batch
- this implies that the batch was already built
- customer said that the person who reported the problem got the error when building the batch
- tested in local instance that updating the status would show the batch in the window
- need to explore further to know the exact status to which the batch should be updated
- requested customer to upload the dumps of the three batch tables involved
