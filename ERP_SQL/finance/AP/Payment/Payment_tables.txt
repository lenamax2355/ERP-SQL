AP_CHECKS_ALL stores information about payments issued to
suppliers or refunds received from suppliers. You need one row for
each payment you issue to a supplier or refund received from a supplier. 
Oracle stores a dummy value for CHECK_STOCK_ID for refunds,
thus, CHECK_STOCK_ID should not be treated as a foreign key to AP_CHECK_STOCKS_ALL 
in the case of refunds

AP_CHECKS_all.PAYMENT_TYPE_FLAG :

Q 	Quick
R 	Refund
