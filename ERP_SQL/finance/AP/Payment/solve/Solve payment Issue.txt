-----------Case 1

1) Take a backup:
.
create table bak_aia as select * from AP_INVOICES_ALL where INVOICE_ID = 48744 and ORG_ID = 81;
.
2) select * from bak_aia;
.
(one record retrieved.)
.
3)

UPDATE ap_invoices_all
SET amount_paid = invoice_amount, payment_status_flag = 'Y'
WHERE invoice_id = 88616;

.
(This should update one record. If yes please COMMIT or else ROLLBACK.)


--------------------Case 2

To implement the solution, please execute the following steps:

1. Void the check number 191 (if not forwarded to supplier);
2. Account and transfer to GL 
3. Run APLISTH again and upload for review.


Now execute the following

update ap_payment_schedules_all
set payment_status_flag='Y',amount_remaining=0
where invoice_id=48743;

1 row updated

update ap_invoices_all
set amount_paid=67406.46,payment_status_flag='Y'
where invoice_id =48743;

1 row updated

commit;
