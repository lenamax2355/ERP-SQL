Hi,

Attached is the undo accounting script.
to reverse the payment accounting and gl you will need to do the following:

If the payment (or part of it) is still in the gl interface table, you can delete it. 
If the payment has been imported then you may need to make an adjusting journal after.

Use the undo accounting script attached and undo the following accounting event ids:
20897
20898
20901
20902

Then void the payments and create new payments.

Then run the accounting process again, ensure the following parameters:
Debug = y
Transfer to gl = n (if accounting is successful you can then do the gl transfer.)

Regards, Mark.

New info : Hi Mark,
Thanks for quick response.
Please inform where to download the undo accounting scripts?

New info : Hi,Mark,
Thank you very much.But we don't know what shall we do.Please show us step by 
step.
Thank you very much.



31-MAR-04 02:32:12 GMT

Hi Harris,

Undo accounting script is attached.
Please complete the steps in METALINK.US 30-MAR-2004 04:45:48 GMT and update the SR.

Thanks, Mark.


31-MAR-04 03:45:47 GMT

New info : Hi Mark,
We have two choices , Could you please help us to make decision ?
Choice 1. If we don't run your un-do script, just correct the GL batch in the 
interface then import the Batch to GL for this period, can Oracle help us to 
fix the problem to close AP "period Mar-2004" later? 
(Now it is at the month end closing , our company can't afford to stop Oracle 
to make Clone, and our Test instance can't re-procedure this error )
Choice2. If We follow your un-do script, we need to stop Oracle 6 hours for 
backup & run /verify , & we may restore back in case fail to fix the wrong AP 
payment transaction. -------Our company didn't recommend us to stop system to 
try choice 2.
Please tell us if choice 1 can be taken --- say , Oracle can help use to fix 
this problem later --- in case we don't run un-do script & correct the GL 
interface to import to GL ? 
BR,
Harris 



31-MAR-04 05:27:30 GMT

Hi,

I sent you the undo accounting script earlier today from my Oracle email account. This is an official script that is used for these types of issues.
The best way forward is to implement the fix outlined in MSTEPHAN.AU 30-MAR-2004 04:2
2:34 GMT.

I understand that you are in the process of backing up Production to test this fix in Test. Please update me once you have completed this.

Regards, Mark.

New info : Please refer to tar 3633606.996, whether need more scripts ?
Best Regards



31-MAR-04 06:46:58 GMT

Hi Henry and Co,

As per our phone discussion, I suggest the following to move this issue forward and to allow you to close your period.:

1. Use the undo accounting script and undo the following accounting event ids:

20897
20898
20901
20902
20903

Therefore you will need to run the script 5 times, once for each event id.

2. Your next step will be to run the sweep program to sweep all unaccounted transactions into the next period (speak to one of your AP users for this)

3. You should now be able to close the period.

This will give us time to fix the payments in the next period.

Regards, Mark.

New info : The above tar is the similar situation with this case and we use 
below steps to fix the problem, and that's why we ask for more script.
Pls read below steps and if it is ok, then we would follow it:-
UPDATE
=============
Henry to fix the old issues:
IMPORTANT: RUN ON TEST FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1. (Client) Query to find out how many problem records there are
select distinct aip.accounting_event_id
from ap_invoice_payments_all aip
where aip.accounting_event_id is not null
and aip.posted_flag = 'Y'
and exists
(select 1 from ap_invoice_payments_all aip2
where aip2.check_id = aip.check_Id
and aip2.accounting_event_id is not null
and aip2.accounting_event_id = aip.accounting_event_id
and aip2.posted_flag != 'Y')
2. (Client) 
create table bug2998717 as
select distinct aip.accounting_event_id
from ap_invoice_payments_all aip
where aip.accounting_event_id is not null
and aip.posted_flag = 'Y'
and exists
(select 1 from ap_invoice_payments_all aip2
where aip2.check_id = aip.check_Id
and aip2.accounting_event_id is not null
and aip2.accounting_event_id = aip.accounting_event_id
and aip2.posted_flag != 'Y')
3. (Client)
3a. select count(*) from bug2998717;
3b. Verify count equals rows returned from step 1
4. (Client) Apply these scripts which will be emailed to you:
APRunBeforeUndoAtgh.sql
APUndoAtgWithBackup.sql
CoreApiHtml.sql
CoreApiTxt.sql
unpost11i.sql
fixevents.sql 
5. (Client) Run APRunBeforeUndoAtgh.sql with the following parameters:
Enter option 2 for Display Selected and Related Event Details(Enter 2)
Enter option 3 for Accounting Events in an Existing Table (Enter 3)
Enter table name = bug2998717
Upload the spooled output to the tar.
6. Upload to Support for review of the output of the report. (STOP AT THIS 
POINT until further advise)
7. (Client) Undo the accounting for the accounted payments affected by 
bug#2998717
7a. Run APUndoAtgWithBackup.sql with the following parameters:
org_id = org_id with problem records
Table Name = bug2998717
Delete Events? = N
7b. Verify correct rows deleted/udpated. Review the rows updated/completed and 
compare to results from
APRunBeforeUndoAtg.sql. If they are the same, COMMIT, otherwise, ROLLBACK.
8. (Client) Run fixevents.sql to fix the payments affected by bug#2998717 (fix 
from datafix bug#3085634)
If data transferred and stuck in the GL_INTERFACE:
9. (Client) Unpost the transfer
9a. Verify period corresponding to transferred data is open in AP. 
9b. Run unpost11i.sql for Transfer Run ID to unpost the transfer.
Text continued in next action...



31-MAR-04 06:59:04 GMT

Text continued from previous action...

If data transfer to GL and posted
10. Create adjusting JEs in GL based on data from APRunBeforeUndoAtgh.sql
11. Run Payables Accounting Process and transfer and verify GL Journal import 
into GL completes successfully.



31-MAR-04 08:32:01 GMT

New info : Clarification on our previous few updates:
It seems that the "APUndoAtgWithBackup.sql" script suggested by Metalink 
support in this TAR is similar to our previous tar 3633606.996. we find that 
although the problem is different, the suggested solution/script/step (i.e. 
undo the transaction and re-post) is similar. Therefore, we would like 
Metalink support to confirm / suggest if there are other scripts/steps needed 
for solving the current problem based on our previous similar knowledge.
Best Regards,
Gary and Jason



31-MAR-04 08:39:48 GMT

New info : Another clarification, we would also like Metalink Support to verify 

and confirm if the steps 1 to 11 (copied from other TAR) can resolve/workaround

the current TAR.
Best Regards,
Gary and Jason



31-MAR-04 23:08:38 GMT

Hi,

The two issue are different. You do not require any additional scripts. 
Please implement the steps outlined in MSTEPHAN.AU 31-MAR-2004 06:46:58 GMT and a
dvise Support of the outcome.

Thanks, Mark.

New info : There is one parameter in your script: 
Table Name - Enter table name with Accounting event id's to undo.
.
Which we need to capture the accounting_event_id before running your 
recommanded script. So it seems that it is not possible to run this script 
alone. Therefore we speculate that there are some preparation step before 
running this recommanded script, pls advise.
.
Regards
Gary




01-APR-04 04:41:06 GMT

Hi Gary,

Please try entering ap_checks when it asks for table parameter.
Let me know if you can then proceed.

New info : The table ap_checks is empty, is that ok?



01-APR-04 06:09:02 GMT

New info : Would you pls check this table(ap_checks)?
Because I found that the parameter table needs to be input should be contain 
the accounting_event_id and I found there is no this field in that table.
.
Furthermore, when I go through the script I found that there is an error 
message ('The table must exist to run this script. Run APRunBeforeUndoAtg.sql 
to create this table');
.
So that I wonder should we run this script before?
.
Regards
Gary



01-APR-04 06:12:03 GMT

New info : Would you please go through the script before tell us "You do not 
require any additional scripts."?

01-APR-04 06:25:38 GMT

Hi Henry,

Please use the attached undo accounting script instead.
It will not ask for table name.
Just undo the accounting event ids mentioned earlier in the SR.

Thanks, Mark.


01-APR-04 06:41:05 GMT

New info : Can you explain more about below parameter:-
REM Display Option - Controls what data to display
REM Select Option - Controls what data to select
REM Table Name (Optional) - Name of table with accounting events to undo
REM Event ID (Optional) - Accounting event id to undo
REM Undo Now - Enter Y to undo accounting for the event(s)
REM Sweep Now - Enter Y to sweep undone accounting from closed periods
REM Sweep to Period - Enter the period to sweep to
REM Delete Event Now - Enter Y only if instructed to do so by support
.
Thanks
Gary



01-APR-04 06:45:39 GMT

Please help us to check it.
Thanks!



01-APR-04 07:32:03 GMT

Hi Henry,

I had already provided this information in MSTEPHAN.AU 31-MAR-2004 06:46:58 GMT.

Yes you will need to run the undo accouning process once for every event id.
Therefore to undo
20897
20898
20901
20902
20903
You will need to run the script six times.
