--------Approval Status:

-- 1.
APPS.AP_INVOICES_ALL.WFAPPROVAL_STATUS



-- 2.
AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL.MATCH_STATUS_FLAG

There is actually no column on the AP_INVOICES_ALL table that corresponds to  the Approval Status of the Invoice.  

The value that appears on the Invoice form is derived from the AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL rows related to the invoice from the column MATCH_STATUS_FLAG.  MATCH_STATUS_FLAG can have the following values: NULL, "A" (Approved), "N" (Not Approved), "T" (Tested).  


The Approval Status is derived as follows:  An Invoice is Never Approved if ALL distributions have MATCH_STATUS_FLAG = NULL An Invoice is Approved if ALL distributions have MATCH_STATUS_FLAG = "A".   If encumbrances are not being used then an Invoice is Approved if ALL  distributions have MATCH_STATUS_FLAG = "A" or "T".  An Invoice is Needs Reapproval if ANY distributions have MATCH_STATUS_FLAG = "N". If encumbrances are being used then an Invoice is Needs Approved if ALL  distributions have MATCH_STATUS_FLAG = "N" or "T".  We also look at unreleased holds on the invoice.  You can have all distributions approved and still have a hold on the invoice. This will set the status to Needs Reapproval for the invoice.
