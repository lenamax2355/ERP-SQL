DOUBLE PAYMENT CANCELLATION EVENTS FOR THE SAME CHECK

A check gets two PAYMENT CANCELLATION events. The first event is orphan and the 2nd won't account because the first is out there.


The following query should return rows.  . 	

select source_id check_id, count(*) 	
from ap_accounting_events_all e 	
where event_type_code = 'PAYMENT CANCELLATION' 	
group by source_id 	
having count(*) > 1 	and min(creation_date) > ( 		select vs.last_update_date 		from po_vendor_sites_all vs 			, ap_checks_all c 		where c.check_id = e.source_id 		and c.vendor_site_id = vs.vendor_site_id);
