1. Download undoatg.zip from ftp://ftp.oracle.com/support/hidden/patchsets/AP/scripts/undoatg.zip

2. Stop all users from using concurrent or on-line accounting until this process is finished.

3. Create a table of the events to undo.

create table TAR_7003884_994_aae as
select distinct accounting_event_id 
from ap_accounting_events_all
where accounting_event_id in (449915,451395,449913)
and source_id in (397316,397314);

4. Undo the Events and report for later GL manipulation

Run UndoAtgh.sql
Enter Org ID: 127
Enter option 1 for Display Selected Event Details 
Enter option 1 to display AP Accounting Data
Enter option 3 for Accounting Events in an Existing Table 
Enter table name = TAR_7003884_994_aae
Enter Y to Undo the Events Now: Y
Enter Y to Sweep to Currently Open Period
Enter the Currently Open Period Name: XXX-05
Enter N to not delete events IDs (You will only get this prompt on 11i.AP.K and above)

commit;

5. Verify if the Invoices got swept:

SELECT accounting_date FROM from ap_accounting_events_all
where accounting_event_id in (449915,451395,449913);





---------not confirmed this solution (samilar with unaccounting SQL)

select *--INVOICE_ID 
from AP_INVOICES_ALL  where Invoice_Num='1234'

select invoice_distribution_id,ACCOUNTING_EVENT_ID from AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL where INVOICE_ID=171457

select * from AP_ACCOUNTING_EVENTS_ALL where SOURCE_ID=171457

delete from AP_AE_LINES_ALL where ae_header_id=147184
