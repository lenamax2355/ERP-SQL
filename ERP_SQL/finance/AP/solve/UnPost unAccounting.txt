SR Number  7003884.994


SOLUTION / ACTION PLAN
=======================
To implement the solution, please execute the following steps:

1. Download ftp://ftp.oracle.com/support/hidden/patchsets/AP/scripts/unpost11i.zip

2. If the original run is in the GL interface then we need to remove it.

a. Backup the GL_Interface

create table SR_7003884_994_gli as
select *
from gl_interface
where group_id in (
select group_id
from xla_gl_transfer_batches_all
where gl_transfer_run_id = 10534 )
and user_je_source_name = 'Payables';


b. Check the count

select count(*) from SR_7003884_994_gli;

-- if there are 0 rows then you either have the wrong run ID or
-- the run has already been posted to the GL. In either case
-- the process should be stopped here and you should not continue.
-- If the count is greater than 0 then you can continue.

c. Delete the rows

set feedback on
delete gl_interface
where group_id in (
select a.group_id
from SR_7003884_994_gli a)
and user_je_source_name = 'Payables';

-- This should delete the same number of rows as the check above.
-- If not then stop and 

rollback;

-- If the count is the same as the check above then 

commit;

3. Run Unpost11i.sql

Run ID: 10534

4. Download undoatg.zip from ftp://ftp.oracle.com/support/hidden/patchsets/AP/scripts/undoatg.zip
If you already have a copy of this script from a previous SR verify that you have version
undoatgh 1.8 or higher. If not download a new copy. The version can be found on the first
line of the undoatgh.sql script.

5. Stop all users from using concurrent or on-line accounting until this process is finished.

6. Create a table of the events to undo.

create table SR_7003884_994_aae
as select *
from ap_accounting_events_all
where accounting_event_id in (449913, 449915, 449917, 449920, 449922, 449924, 449925, 449928
)
and source_id in (397314, 397316, 397318, 397320, 397321, 397323, 397326, 397328);

create table SR_7003884_994_ai
as select *
from ap_invoices_all
where invoice_id in (397314, 397316, 397318, 397320, 397321, 397323, 397326, 397328);


create table SR_7003884_994_aid
as select *
from ap_invoice_distributions_all
where invoice_id in (397314, 397316, 397318, 397320, 397321, 397323, 397326, 397328);

7. Undo the Events and report for later GL manipulation

Run UndoAtgh.sql
Enter Org ID: 127
Enter option 1 for Display Selected Event Details 
Enter option 1 to display AP Accounting Data
Enter option 3 for Accounting Events in an Existing Table 
Enter table name = SR_7003884_994_aae
Undo the Events Now: Y
Enter N to Sweep to Currently Open Period
Enter N to not delete events IDs (You will only get this prompt on 11i.AP.K and above)

COMMIT; <<< the script does not self-commit

8. Update the data

update ap_invoices_all
set exchange_rate = NULL,
exchange_date = NULL,
exchange_rate_type = NULL
where invoice_id in (select a.invoice_id
from SR_7003884_994_ai a);

--this will update 8 rows

update ap_invoice_distributions_all
set exchange_rate = NULL,
exchange_date = NULL,
exchange_rate_type = NULL,
base_amount = NULL
where invoice_id in (select a.invoice_id
from SR_7003884_994_aid a);

--this will update 24 rows

commit;

9. Run the Payables Accounting process and verify the results.

10. Allow users to run the accounting process again.
