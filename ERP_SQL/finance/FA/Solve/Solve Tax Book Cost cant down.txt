select * from apps.BMC_FA_TRANSACTION_HEAD_BAK where asset_id = 100029502   and book_type_code = 'BMC_TAX_BOOK' 
--and transaction_header_id = 251233

select * from apps.BMC_FA_ADJUSTMENTS_BAK where asset_id = 100029502 and book_type_code = 'BMC_TAX_BOOK' 
--and transaction_header_id = 251233

select * from apps.BMC_FA_BOOKS_BAK where asset_id = 100029502 and book_type_code = 'BMC_TAX_BOOK'  
--and transaction_header_id_in = 251233

where asset_id = 100029502 and book_type_code = 'BMC_TAX_BOOK'
and transaction_header_id = 251233 ;

-- should delete 3 rows

delete FA_BOOKS 
where asset_id = 100029502 and book_type_code = 'BMC_TAX_BOOK'
and transaction_header_id_in = 251233 ;

-- should delete 1 row

update FA_BOOKS 
set transaction_header_id_out = NULL,
date_ineffective = NULL
where asset_id = 100029502
