Ideally run the autoinvoice purge program first. If you find that
this does not delete the unwanted entries in tables then you
could use the below mentioned script.

Kindly use the below mentioned script if and only if the ra_interface_lines_all
do not have any entries.

You could use the below mentioned script for taking a backup 
and deleting the errors table

create backup_int_errors
as (select * from ra_interface_errors_all)

delete from ra_interface_errors_all

OR

Also kindly note that there is a system options called "Purge Interface tables"
in the follwoing navigation:

Receivables Setup > SystemOptions > Trans and Customers tab page.

If this option is checked the processed interface lines are deleted automatically
after each and every autoinvoice run.

Kindly revert back if you need further clarity on the above issue.
If you feel that you query has been asnwered to your satisfaction kindly close the TAR

THanks and Regards,

Please see uploaded puge autoinvoice log file.
Looks this puge only delete from
RA_INTERFACE_DISTRIBUTIONS,RA_INTERFACE_SALESCREDITS,RA_INTERFACE_LINES,
but not delete from apps.ra_interface_errors_all

So if we run this puge function when has lines in the RA_INTERFACE_LINES_all table, then we would lost these records, right ?

select * from apps.ra_interface_errors_all 

select * from apps.ra_interface_errors
