                   Doc ID: Note:175733.1Type: PROBLEM
                   Last Revision Date: 02-NOV-2003Status: PUBLISHED



fact: Oracle Receivables
fact: RAXTRX - Autoinvoice Import Program
symptom: Rows are not picked up by Autoinvoice
symptom: Rows are stuck in the RA_INTERFACE_LINES_ALL Table
symptom: RA_INTERFACE_LINES_ALL.REQUEST_ID is not null
symptom: RA_INTERFACE_LINES_ALL.INTERFACE_STATUS is not equal to 'P'
cause: If the request_id is not null then any run of Autoinvoice with a 
different request id will ignore that line.

This situation will happen if Autoinvoice has a fatal error.



fix:

Clear the request IDs so that Autoinvoice can pick up the line.

1.  First be sure that Autoinvoice is not running.

2.  Clear the request ids.

		UPDATE ra_interface_lines_all
		SET interface_line_id = null,
		    customer_trx_id = null,
		    request_id = null,
		    link_to_line_id = null
		WHERE nvl(interface_status,'x') != 'P';

3.  Commit;

4.  Rerun Autoinvoice and check the log.
