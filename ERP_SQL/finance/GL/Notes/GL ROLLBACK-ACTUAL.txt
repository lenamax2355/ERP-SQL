                   Rolling Back Actual Account Balances

This bulletin describes how to rollback all actual account balances to a
particular accounting period for a specific set of books. It does not describe
how to do a selective rollback of actual balances, budget or encumbrance
balances in Oracle General Ledger.

This bulletin consists of the following sections:

   -- WHY ROLLBACK ACTUAL ACCOUNT BALANCES

   -- AFFECTED GENERAL LEDGER TABLES

   -- THE ROLLBACK SCRIPT

   -- POST ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

   -- A NOTE ABOUT ROLLBACKS THAT CROSS FISCAL YEARS

   -- REFERENCES


                               WARNING!

Use this bulletin only with the assistance of Oracle Support Services. Oracle 
does not support the update of your financial database through Sql*Plus without 
the consent of Oracle.  Please contact Oracle for assistance.

Before attempting any database update, ensure no users or processes are
accessing or updating the financial database. We also recommend a full export
of your database for recovery purposes.


WHY ROLLBACK ACTUAL ACCOUNT BALANCES
------------------------------------

The only time you would ever rollback actual account balances is in the case
of a corrupt GL Balances table. Database corruption to this table happens
rarely, and it usually results from an unsupported update to the database.

This procedure can be time consuming because you must re-post all your
journal entries for the corrupted periods. Also, if you translate your account
balances to a foreign currency, you have to rerun translation for each
period you are rolling back.

Because you have to re-post journals for the periods you are rolling back,
you CANNOT perform a rollback of actual account balances if you have
deleted, archived or corrupted your journal entries.


AFFECTED GENERAL LEDGER TABLES
------------------------------

The following General Ledger tables are updated:

GL_BALANCES
GL_JE_BATCHES
GL_JE_HEADERS
GL_JE_LINES
GL_PERIOD_STATUSES
GL_SETS_OF_BOOKS
GL_TRANSLATION_TRACKING


THE ROLLBACK SCRIPT
-------------------

Read this entire section before attempting any update described in the steps.

We use the following case study to explain the rollback script.

Fremont Manufacturing's corporate set of books period status for the current
fiscal year is:

        Period          System Name     Status
        ---------       -----------     ------------
        January         JAN-99          Closed
        February        FEB-99          Closed
        March           MAR-99          Closed
        April           APR-99          Closed
        May             MAY-99          Open
        June            JUN-99          Closed
        July            JUL-99          Future Entry
        August          AUG-99          Never Opened
        September       SEP-99          Never Opened
        October         OCT-99          Never Opened
        November        NOV-99          Never Opened
        December        DEC-99          Never Opened

Journal entries exist for periods January through July. Period June 99 was
opened and some journals posted, but now is closed.

Fremont Manufacturing was about to close their current open period, May 99,
for the corporate set of books when they discovered some of the period
account balances for March 99 were incorrect, thus causing the forward balances
to be off. Someone had made an unsupported update to account balances
through Sql*Plus.

The Accounting Department determined that the actual account balances up to
February 99 were correct and decided to rollback balances to February 99.

Complete every step below for a successful rollback.

STEP 1. Backup Your Database
---------------------------

Backup your datbase before proceeding with any update included in this
bulletin.

STEP 2. Determine SET_OF_BOOKS_ID
---------------------------------
Each set of books in your General Ledger has an associated id. Execute the
following query to determine the SET_OF_BOOKS_ID for the book you want to
update:

        select set_of_books_id, name from GL_SETS_OF_BOOKS
        where name = 'Fremont Corporate';

Substitute your set of books name for the string 'Fremont Corporate'.

STEP 3. Determine Periods to Delete
-----------------------------------

Determine the period balance rows in GL_BALANCES that need to delete.

In the case study, the period to rollback to is February 99. The periods that
have corrupt balances are March, April, May and June.

Because the period status for JUN-99 is closed, it had to have been opened at
some point in time, thus there are balances for June which are corrupt.

The best way to determine what period rows you need to be delete from
GL_BALANCES is to do the following query:

        select distinct period_name from GL_BALANCES
        where set_of_books_id = <set of books id found in step 2>
        and actual_flag = 'A'
        and period_year = <year of the period you are rolling back to>;

This query will return the period names for which actual balance rows exist
for the set of books in the accounting year specified. If you have defined
periods for future accounting/fiscal years, run the query for these years to
verify the existence of corrupt rows that may have crossed into your future
fiscal years. This is possible if you had at any time opened the first period
of a new fiscal year.

Take note of all the period names that follow the period you are rolling back
to, including those for future accounting years. These period rows will be
deleted.

Step 4. Delete from GL_BALANCES
-------------------------------

Execute the following script to delete the corrupt period balances:

        delete from GL_BALANCES
        where period_name in ('MAR-99', 'APR-99', 'MAY-99', 'JUN-99')
        and set_of_books_id = <set of books id found in step 2>
        and actual_flag = 'A';

        commit;

In this script substitute your list of period names you noted in Step
3 and supply the set of books id found in Step 2.  Be sure to verify the list
of periods you are deleting.  You must delete all period balances that follow
the period you are rolling back to. You cannot do a selective delete of period
balances. If you commit this change to the database and discover a mistake,
you must restore your database.

Step 5. Reset Journal Statuses
------------------------------

Execute the following script to update your journal entries so they can be
re-posted.

        update GL_JE_BATCHES set status = 'U', status_verified = 'N' where
        default_period_name in ('MAR-99', 'APR-99', 'MAY-99', 'JUN-99') and
        actual_flag = 'A' and
        set_of_books_id = <set of books id found in step 2>;

        update GL_JE_HEADERS set status = 'U' where
        period_name in ('MAR-99', 'APR-99', 'MAY-99', 'JUN-99') and
        actual_flag = 'A' and
        set_of_books_id = <set of books id found in step 2>;

        update GL_JE_LINES set status = 'U' where
        period_name in ('MAR-99', 'APR-99', 'MAY-99', 'JUN-99') and
        set_of_books_id = <set of books id found in step 2> and
        je_header_id in (select je_header_id from gl_je_headers
                         where period_name in
                         ('MAR-99', 'APR-99', 'MAY-99', 'JUN-99') and
                         actual_flag = 'A');

        commit;

Substitute the string  MAR-99, APR-99, MAY-99,JUN-99 with your list of
period names you noted in Step 3. Supply the set of books id found in Step
2.


Step 6. Update Period Statuses
------------------------------

Update GL_PERIOD_STATUSES to make the period you are rolling back to, the
current open period and the others future entry.

This allows the journal entries for the periods to exist in the system and the
correct balances to be rolled forward as you reopen each period.

        update GL_PERIOD_STATUSES set closing_status = 'O'
        where period_name = 'FEB-99'
        and set_of_books_id = <set of books id found in step 2>
        and application_id = 101;

        update GL_PERIOD_STATUSES
        set closing_status = 'F'
        where period_name in ('MAR-99', 'APR-99', 'MAY-99', 'JUN-99')
        and set_of_books_id = <set of books id found in step 2>
        and application_id = 101;

        commit;

Application_id = 101 indicates you are updating the period status for General
Ledger. DO NOT specify any other application id except 101.  Substitute
'FEB-99' with the period name to which you are rolling back. In the second
update statement replace the period list with the period list you noted in
Step 3. Be sure to supply the correct set of books id for each statement.

Step 7. Reset GL_SETS_OF_BOOKS
------------------------------

Reset the latest opened period for the set of books to the period to which you
are rolling back.

        update GL_SETS_OF_BOOKS
        set latest_opened_period_name = 'FEB-99'
        where set_of_books_id = <set of books id found in step 2>;

        commit;

Substitute 'FEB-99' with the period name you are rolling back to, and provide
the set of books id.

Step 8. Reset Translation Status
--------------------------------

If you translate your account balance you need to reset the table
GL_TRANSLATION_TRACKING to retranslate.

        update GL_TRANSLATION_TRACKING
        set earliest_never_period_name = 'MAR-99',
        earliest_never_period_year = <accounting period year>,
        earliest_never_period_num = <period number>
        where set_of_books_id = <set of books id found in step 2>;

        commit;

Substitute MAR-99 with the period name after the period to which you are
rolling back (In our example, we did a rollback to FEB-99, the period after
February is MAR-99).  Substitute accounting period year and number with the
year and number that corresponds to the period name you are setting.

Step 9. Delete old translation statuses for rolled-back periods 
--------------------------------------------------------------- 

This MUST be run after Step 8: Reset Translation Status.

If you translated your account balances, you need to delete the old 
translation statuses (in GL_TRANSLATION_STATUSES) for periods which 
have been rolled back. 

        delete from GL_TRANSLATION_STATUSES TS 
        where TS.set_of_books_id = <set of books id found in step 2> 
        and exists 
       (select PS.period_name 
        from GL_PERIOD_STATUSES PS, GL_TRANSLATION_TRACKING TR 
          where TR.set_of_books_id = TS.set_of_books_id 
          and TR.bal_seg_value  = TS.bal_seg_value 
          and TR.target_currency = TS.target_currency 
          and TR.actual_flag = TS.actual_flag 
          and TR.average_translation_flag = TS.average_translation_flag 
          and PS.application_id  = 101 
          and PS.set_of_books_id = TR.set_of_books_id 
          and PS.period_name = TS.period_name 
          and (PS.effective_period_num <       
          ( TR.earliest_ever_period_year * 10000 + TR.earliest_ever_period_num ) 
             OR 
           PS.effective_period_num >= (TR.earliest_never_period_year 
             * 10000 + TR.earliest_never_period_num ))); 

      COMMIT; 

POST ROLLBACK PROCEDURES
========================

Step 1. Open Periods and Post
-----------------------------

After you have performed the rollback script, reopen each period and re-post
the journals for that period.

You have to open the periods in order, starting with the period after the
period you rolled back to. In the case study, the first period we would reopen
is MAR-99.

We recommend you open one period at a time and post all journal entries for
that period before opening the next period. This will prevent the additional
overhead of the posting program having to carry forward multiple period
balances.

We also recommend running trial balance reports for each period before
opening the next, insuring correct balances.

Note: If you have disabled any code combinations used in these journal
entries from the time the journal entries were originally created and posted,
you will need to enable them again.


Step 2. Re-submit Translation
-----------------------------

If you translate your account balances, you have to re-submit translation for
each period, from and to currency, and balancing segment.


A NOTE ABOUT ROLLBACKS THAT CROSS FISCAL YEARS
----------------------------------------------

This script is appropriate to prior fiscal years. If you rollback to a
prior year you must realize that the re-posting of journal entries will be time
consuming. We recommed you verify the retained earnings account for all
balancing segments when you reopen the first period of the fiscal year.
