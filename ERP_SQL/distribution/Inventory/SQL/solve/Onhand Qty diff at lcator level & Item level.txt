Uppacked onhand Item,
Locator level (Qty=3300) & Item Level (Qty=3000). The diff is 300. And more we 
find the onhand detail table has a record of Qty=300, it's CONTAINERIZED_FLAG 
=1 while other lines = 2.And more,we find this line's LPN_ID has a value.Then 
we check the LPN table,LPN_Context=11,no record at LPN_Context table for this 
LPN_ID



SR Number  5335691.992 


Material Workbench can't see Item level,Packed but can't see LPN number
(onhand CONTAINERIZED_FLAG =1,has LPN)
