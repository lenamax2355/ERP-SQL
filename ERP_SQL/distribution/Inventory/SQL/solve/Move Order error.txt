-------Mover Order error, Cost Group_ID diff between Onhand & LPN

----------Solve , update the CG on wms_license_plate_numbers
----------Also check the lpn_context on wms_license_plate_numbers, update to 1 if it is not 1

select  lpn_ID,lpn_context from apps.wms_license_plate_numbers  WHERE  LICENSE_PLATE_NUMBER='M0030331'        

update from 8 to 1

select * from apps.wms_lpn_contents WHERE parent_lpn_ID=614134

update COST_GROUP_ID to 1008

select COST_GROUP_ID from apps.wms_lpn_contents WHERE parent_lpn_ID=578697

update to 1009


----------------Research to find the solution:

1. Find out the move order number & Item number, to find out the LPN

2. Check Onhand & LPN's CostGroup_ID

3. Check LPN's lpn_context

select lpn_ID,lpn_context from apps.wms_license_plate_numbers  WHERE  LICENSE_PLATE_NUMBER='S0020150'

select COST_GROUP_ID from apps.wms_lpn_contents WHERE parent_lpn_ID=578697

select COST_GROUP_ID from apps.mtl_onhand_quantities_detail where LPN_ID=578697
