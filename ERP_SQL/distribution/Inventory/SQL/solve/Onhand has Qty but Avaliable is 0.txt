-------Onhand has Qty but Avaliable is Zero
	--this because the wms_lpn_contents.COST_GROUP_ID = null, 
	  & wms_lpn_contents.PARENT_LPN_ID has value but MTL_ONHAND_QUANTITIES_DETAIl.lpn_id has no record

---------If there is no LPN on the task, then check the Status of SO & Ship Trans,mostly the SO has allocated by not yet shipped!
		(In this case, Onhand<>avaliable, avaliable=0,decreased, buy onhand not decreased)

LPN content is wrong .

select * from apps.MTL_ONHAND_QUANTITIES_DETAIl where lpn_id=489100

select * from apps.wms_license_plate_numbers  WHERE  LICENSE_PLATE_NUMBER='S0025689'   (check LPN_CONTEXT)

select * from apps.wms_lpn_contents WHERE parent_lpn_id=489100  (check CostGroup)

update APPS.WMS_LICENSE_PLATE_NUMBERS set LPN_CONTEXT=1 where LICENSE_PLATE_NUMBER=''



-----------------Onhand has Qty but Avaliable is Zero (SO Pick release task can't use the LPN !)

1. To check the LPN_CONTEXT of this LPN
select LPN_CONTEXT,lpn_id from apps.wms_license_plate_numbers  WHERE  LICENSE_PLATE_NUMBER='CNCB5+DVMXR0'

LPN_CONTEXT=11 (picked)

2. update APPS.WMS_LICENSE_PLATE_NUMBERS set LPN_CONTEXT=1 where LICENSE_PLATE_NUMBER='CNCB5+DVMXR0'
Change the LPN_CONTEXT=1, then can finish the task!
