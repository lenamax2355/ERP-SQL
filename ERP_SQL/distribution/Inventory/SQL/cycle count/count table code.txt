MTL_CYCLE_COUNT_ENTRIES 
stores the actual counts of a cycle
count. A row in this table without a count is considered to be a count
request. Oracle Inventory uses this information to determine and store
cycle count adjustments, recounts, and approval requirements.

When a cycle count adjustment is approved, the count status is set to
completed and the adjustment amount field is populated. The Cycle
Count Approval form then calls a user exit to post an entry in the
MTL_MATERIAL_TRANSACTIONS_TEMP, from which the Oracle
Inventory Transaction Processor picks it up and does the accounting,
costing, and history update.
