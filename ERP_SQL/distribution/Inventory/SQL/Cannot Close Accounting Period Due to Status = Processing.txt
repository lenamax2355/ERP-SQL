Please refer the Note 273922.1: INCTPC -Cannot Close Accounting Period Due to Status = Processing


After experiencing a problem with the concurrent managers where the log file 
directory was unavailable, the manager were restarted 

At the time the concurrent manager went down, there were five Close Accounting Period jobs that failed during that time (due to an APP-1084). The Close Accounting Period screen shows a status of Processing.

To determine the status of the processes, use the following:
---------
select organization_id, acct_period_id, period_close_date
from org_acct_periods
where open_flag = 'P' ; (means processing like in process)

organization_id acct_period_id period_close_date
203 1403 01-MARCH-2004
207 1407 01-MARCH-2004
329 1402 01-MARCH-2004
349 1409 01-MARCH-2004
350 1410 01-MARCH-2004

This means it is needed to set the open_flag = Y (open) and the period_close_date = 
NULL so that the period close process can be resubmitted.


Cause
The customer had a problem with the concurrent managers where the log file 
directory was unavailable.

The concurrent managers going down caused the period close concurrent processing to be stuck as in process and error out with APP-1084

Fix
1. Backup the table org_acct_periods (This is a critical step and cannot be skipped)

2. Run the following to determine the process in error:

select organization_id, acct_period_id, period_close_date
from org_acct_periods
where open_flag = 'P' ; (means processing like in process)


3. Run the following script to reset the organization acct_period in order to close the period again:

Update org_acct_periods
set open_flag = 'Y',
period_close_date = NULL
where organization_id in (203,207,329,349,350)
and acct_period_id in (1403,1407,1402,1409,1410)
and open_flag = 'P';

In this case, the update was on the correct 5 rows. 
Then commit.

3. Rerun the period close process only for one org_id.
Confirm that it completes successfully. 
Be sure it launches a transfer to GL concurrent request which should also complete normally. 

4. Check the MTL_TRANSACTION_ACCOUNTS and WIP_TRANSACTION_ACCOUNTS tables so verify there are no longer any records for the period with gl_batch_id = -1 which confirms the records were sent to GL.

5. Continue with closing the remaining periods as returned by the script in #2 above.
