WMS_DISPATCHED_TASKS

Table that holds all the tasks that are :
(1) Dispatched to the user (user has accepted a task)
(2) Queued to the user (assigned to the user manually)
(3) Loaded (user has loaded the task on to his equipment but has not dropped it off yet)
(4) Erred 
This table holds a pointer to the MTL_MATERIAL_TRANSACTIONS_TEMP table, via the transaction temp id. All the information necessary for the performance of a task (item, location, qty etc. ) is stored in the MTL_MATERIAL_TRANSACTIONS_TEMP table. The WMS_DISPATCHED_TASKS table holds all the information about the actual performance of the task (i.e. the user, equipment, task dispatched time, loaded time etc.)
