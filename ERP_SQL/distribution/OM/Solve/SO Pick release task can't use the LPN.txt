1. To check the LPN_CONTEXT of this LPN
select LPN_CONTEXT,lpn_id from apps.wms_license_plate_numbers  WHERE  LICENSE_PLATE_NUMBER='CNCB5+DVMXR0'

LPN_CONTEXT=11 (picked)

2. update APPS.WMS_LICENSE_PLATE_NUMBERS set LPN_CONTEXT=1 where LICENSE_PLATE_NUMBER='CNCB5+DVMXR0'
Change the LPN_CONTEXT=1, then can finish the task!


3.If this doesn't solve, try to delete task, recreate task
