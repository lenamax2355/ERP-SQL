Symptoms
The sales order line is in Fulfilled status.
The delivery is in Interfaced status.
But there are no material transactions to be found for this line item.


Solution
The above queries suggest that the item was defined as non-transactable when
the delivery detail was created. Hence the pickable_flag is 'N' and inventory
interfaced is marked 'Not Applicable'. Also move order lines(and reservations)
are not created since the item was non-transactable.

Most likely the item attribute was modified sometime after booking. No data
fix is available for this situation (according to Development in Bug 3553185).
Newly created orders should process fine.


select pickable_flag 
from apps.wsh_delivery_details 
where delivery_detail_id = 1228425 
--- returns 'N' ----- 

select mtl_transactions_enabled_flag 
from apps.mtl_system_items 
where inventory_item_id = &Inventory_item_id
and organization_id = &Org_id
--- returns 'Y' -----
