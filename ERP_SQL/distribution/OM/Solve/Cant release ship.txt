-----------2009-Nov
SO 281318,after release,the shipping transaction status changed to 'staged/pick confirmed' but no task was performed and no Sales Order pick transaction created 
after backorder, the status changed to 'not applicable'.

Because Item MTL_TRANSACTIONS_ENABLED_FLAG=N when book SO,make Wsh_Delivery_Details.PICKABLE_FLAG=N (SR aggree)
Before really run SO pick, many table not created record,easy to fix:

update Apps.Wsh_Delivery_Details set Released_Status='B',INV_INTERFACED_FLAG='N',PICKABLE_FLAG='Y' where  
Source_Header_Id =992239


SR 7777251.994
This kinds only could cancel SO, SR can't give fix!



-----BMC SOlution:
     Order Team to cancel-delete Old SO,DBA importnew SO(with same SE PO/line).Order Team book it.
     Old WIP Order already completed, no change JO,label no change.CIQ use SE PO,no problem. IE needs change old SO to new SO.

--------------Below are 2008-Oct write:
the shipping transaction status of so 230639 changed to 'staged/pick confirmed' although no task was performed and no material transaction. after backorder this so, the status changed to 'not applicable'.

if the released status of wsh_delivery_details is 'X' or 'Y', the details required option was set to yes, so pick release can't be performed.


update apps.wsh_delivery_details wdd set released_status='R'
   where wdd.SOURCE_HEADER_ID=680273
 

apps.wsh_delivery_details.RELEASED_STATUS

R:	Ready to Release
S:	Released to Warehouse
Y:	Staged/Pick Confirmed
B:	Backordered
C	Interfaced
