REM | DESCRIPTION                                                           |
REM |     This script has been created to allow cancelling those lines      |
REM |     which are stuck due to some data corruption  and can neither      |
REM |     be progressed nor cancelled from the application. You may only use| 
REM |     it on order lines as authorized by Oracle Support.                |
REM |     This script will do the following:                                |
REM |                                                                       |
REM |     1. Update Lines to show as if Cancelled.                          |
REM |     2. Cancel Delivery Details(if any) associated to order lines.     |
REM |     3. Marks the Move Order Lines as 'Cancelled by Source' for any    |
REM |        'Released to Warehouse' details (for INV / OPM Orgs)           |
REM |     4. Deletes any Serial Number(s) associated with Staged/Shipped    |
REM |        Delivery Details and Unmarks them                              |
REM |     5. Cancel OPM Inventory data in case of OPM Org                   |
REM |     6. Progress flow(if exists) to CLOSE.                             |
REM |                                                                       |
REM |     Note that this script DOES NOT:                                   |
REM |                                                                       |
REM |     1. Cancel Line if it belongs to (a)WMS Organization; and          |
REM |        (b)has open delivery details                                   |
REM |     2. Cancel Line if OTM Integration is enabled for Organization     |
REM |     3. Delink the Configured Items  that  may exist on  an order.     |
REM |     4. Update the  history tables with  cancellation information.     |
REM |     5. Unschedule the Lines. Inventory  patch # 2471362 should be     |
REM |        applied  after running this  script to relieve the demand.     |
REM |     6. Update Move Order Lines, log a clean bug against inventory     |
REM |     7. Update Supply.                                                 |
REM |                                                                       |

REM |     Do not use  this script as a replacement for OM Cancellation      |
REM |     functionality as it is  strictly meant for those stuck  order     |
REM |     lines which can neither be progressed nor cancelled from the      |
REM |     application.                                                      |

REM |     Proofread the script prior to running it. Due to differences      |
REM |     in the way text editors,email packages and operating systems      |
REM |     handle text  formatting (spaces, tabs and carriage returns),      |
REM |     this script may not be in an executable state when you first      |
REM |     receive it.  Check over the script to  ensure that errors of      |
