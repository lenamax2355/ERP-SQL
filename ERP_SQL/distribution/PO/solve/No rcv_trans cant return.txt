Hi Hongwei,

Thank you for the uploaded RCV11i output.

This shows that for PO Line 5, there are no rows in RCV_TRANSACTIONS although the PO LI
ne is marked as being fully received.
The RCV11i does show the TRANACTION_ID that were assigned to the receipt transactions, but these are not used by the SQL
that returns data in the RCV11i.
.
ACTION PLAN
============
We need to confirm if these rows do exist.

[1] Please provide the output of the following XLS format with Col. Headings, if rows are returned.

select * from rcv_transactions where transaction_id in (2309713, 2309714, 2309715, 2309716, 2309717, 2309718, 230971

UPDATE
=======
Hi Hongwei,

Data in the table RCV_TRANSACTIONS are never deleted from the table by the application as this table is the history table for rece
ipts.
Every parts of the receipt transaction looks complete except for the rows missing in RCV_TRANSACTIONS.
The fact that we have TRANSACTION_ID values indicates that these rows existed at some point.

We will have to request a data fix from Development.
.
ACTION PLAN
============
[1] Was any SQL used at any point on this table that may have resulted in these rows being deleted ?

we need data fix today, please be quick!

UPDATE
=======
Hi Hongwei,

Development are reluctant to recreate such vital data without first knowing how it came to be missing.
The data in the table RCV_TRANSACTIONS is central to how Receiving works and Development can confirm that n
o standard
oracle code deletes rows from this table.

I have asked then again, but they may not be willing to provide such a fix.

GLOBAL SR ESCALATION ACTION PLAN - PUBLISHED ACTION:
=====================================================

Summary
=======
# Customer reports that some records are missing in rcv_transactions (RT) table, even thoug
h they are referenced at other places (RT.rcv_transaction_id). 
# The fact that rcv_transaction_id values exist at other tables is an indication that these reco
rds were created by the system, and they are somehow missing now. Not sure how 
customer ended up at this data state. 
# Customer seeks a datafix to re-insert these records in RT table - this is where expectations need to be set clearly. 
-- Only Oracle Dev can provide any authorized datafix ... not Oracle Support.
-- Oracle Dev will provide a datafix only if the issue is caused by application ...
not for any other reasons/causes. 
-- The application is clearly coded NOT to delete records from this RT table, hence we are certain that the currently report
ed issue is NOT casued by the standard application. 
# A bug was already logged with Oracle Dev, but the chances of getting a datafix are slim unless we provide
a reproducible test case, or an evidence that this issue IS caused BY standard 
application. Otherwise customer will have to conduct their own investigation on 
why only a few records are missing from a certain table, and what needs to be do
ne to recover them. Then, they may need Consulting assistance to address this is
sue. 
# Clearly there is a mismatch between Customer expecations, and Oracle Support/Dev service scope. If this is not clarified, then in may required the manag
ement level interactions betwen these two entities. 


Action Plan
===========
# Customer:
- Provide a reproducible test case or an evidence that issue was caused by standard applicaiton ... they are necessary for Oracle Dev to consider thi
s as a bug and provide a datafix. 
- Please discuss this with your management as well as your Service Delivery Manager as the requested service is out of scope 
for Oracle Support/Dev. 
# Support:
- Explore with Dev if any other customers have reported similar issues, and if it were due to standard code (chances are sli
m as we know from our experience as well as code reviews that standard applicati
on does not cause this). 
- Let's try our best to guide the customer in addressing the issue, but let's also keep in mind that this out of scope of Oracle Suppo
rt/Dev. 


Communication Plan
==================
# SR updates or phone calls as required


De-escalation Plan
==================
# This issue is out of scope of Oracle Support/Dev, hence does not fall under the escalation ambit, nevertheles
s setting the escalation flag so it catches the attention of Support Management.

# We should de-escalate if customer does not provide either a reproducible test case or an evidence that issue was caused by standard application, in the next
one week. 


Other
=====
# Customer should discuss the issue with their management and their SDM. Should they need further technical assistance that is within 
the Oracle Support/Dev scope, then please contact the Escalation Owning-MAnager:

.
UPDATE
=======
Hi Hongwei,

Development have provided the following reason as to why a data fix is not possible...

1. It is not known how may RTs are missing for each shipment line.
2. We are not aware of the transaction types that were performed before they started missing in RT.
3. There could be transfers, inspections, corrections etc etc.
- No one has an idea about the history of transactions to be created.
4. Also, for instance, we do not know what should be the qty, uom, location etc etc for each record. 
- Those are just some sample columns which we mentioned.
.
So, it is not feasible for us to provide a datafix script to populate missing records in rcv_transactions. 

Thanks,
Richard

Hi,

Quite understand your concerns.

In this case,there is no physical item was received(as user confirmed) on the PO line but PO location line show full received(so user asked 
to return).

As the receiving transaction (RT) was not created & user just want PO don't show the receive qty, after fully checking make sure the receiving 
transaction was not create physical inventory & finance entry , can we fix data 
in another direction ? Not try to complete the receiving transaction, instead 
try to remove it (this looks more easy in this case may be).

Thanks,

Hi Hongwei,

Regardless to whether items were Physically receipted, the items were recorded as being Receipted.
They have also been billed, which means there is a matching invoice tied to the PO line.
If the Development were to offer a data fix for the PO and Receiving side, you will still have the pro
blem on the AP side.

Hi,

First of all, no deletion of any records on rcv_transaction table.
The missing record must be the running result of Oracle EBS-this is fact no need otherthing to prove.

If difficult for Development team to fix their way , could try another way to fix-cancel the 
receipt Qty on the PO line as no stock transaction for it.

Hi Hongwei,

Development may be prepared to provide a data fix that will 'reset' the PO Line as though it had never been receipted.
I am going to ask them to consider this fix.

UPDATE

Hello,

Oracle Development provided the following feedback :
<quote>
Insertion of records into rcv_transactions is not possible. 
We cannot come up with scripts to insert into rcv_transactions table. 
We have never done that as it is infeasible to provide such a datafix. 

Moreover nowhere in our code deletion from rcv_transactions table happens. 
This may be due to customization or someone has unknowingly deleted the RT data from backend. We do not see any 
other possible reason for the same. Closing this as not a bug. 
<unquote>

Once you have acknowledged Oracle Development update, please let us know if this SR c
an be inactivated.
Thanks and regards,
Solange (on behalf of Richard)

Hi ,

Firstly no deleteion of records & no customization on this area.
There is possibility that EBS to create records in shipment table then failed to create record in rcv_transaction table in some 
circumstance, this is very naturally reason & possibility.

Think Oracle Develop team needs more knowledge Oracle function & business process. Because 
from the feedback of them, looks they didn't get the whole picture 
yet...


Here say the other direction of fix - cancel the receipt Qty on the PO line,
obvously nobody (except Oracle Develop team) would think to delete records from rcv_transaction or else,that's no reason to do that (& think about 
that!).

Could think about update the Received Quantity on PO files, that's the in-correct data caused from this issue.

Please show us that support team could understand the whole picture...

Hi Hongwei,

Development understand the issue and so does Support.
There is no code in the application that deletes records from the RT table.
Development have said they will not provide a data fix to recreate the missing R
T.
I have asked Development to consider a data fix where the PO is reset.

Thanks,
Richard
