The following files were uploaded for SR number 6417874.992:

C:\Documents_and_Settings\28952561\Desktop\SR\blanket_po_category\Apps_Check_120707.txt


This SR was saved as a draft on: 11-JUL-2007 20:10:58

### Detailed Problem Statement ###
We use item category as a creteria to approval blanket PO. The item category is from master org. But normally we do not maintain item category in master org. 
So sometimes when we issue PO, the item category is wrong. Because the PO status
is already 'Requires Reapproval', we can't cancel the wrong PO line or delete i
t or approve it.

### Steps to Reproduce ###
create a PO line in blanket PO without maintain the correct item category in master org -> save -> the PO approval
status changed to 'Requires Reapproval'.

### Instance Name and Type of System ###
production instance

### Recent Changes ###
N/A

### Workaround ###
we used to delete the PO line in database, but we don't want to use this method in the f
uture.

### Impact on Business ###
Update database should not be a standard function to solve this problem.

Can you easily recover from, bypass or work around the problem? 
No

Does your system or application continue normally after the problem occurs? 
No

Are the standard features of the system or application still available; is the loss of service minor?
Yes

That's why they are in the patch. The functionality to allow to " cancel PO line" in those forms.

POXPOEPO => (N) Purchase Orders -> Purchase Orders , the form that you create a new PO
POXPOVPO => (N) Purchase Orders -> Purchase Order Summary , the form that you qu
ery the existed PO
POXPOERL => (N) Purchase Orders -> Releases , the form that you release BPA ( Blanket Purchase Agreement )
POXRQERQ => (N) Requisitions -> Requisitions , the form you create a new requisitions.
